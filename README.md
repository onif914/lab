## Part One
### 1. ship size
#### Strings are actually one-dimensional array of characters terminated by a null character '\0'.
#### If you define:
```
char greeting[] = "Hello";
```
#### The actually storage has one more character than the word "Hello."
```
char greeting[6] = {'H', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o', '\0'};
```
#### Therefore, The size of ship array is 11:
```
char ship[11] = ".........." //10 dots
```
* Actually, if defining 10 and print it out,  the result will be 10 dots with a weird character at the end"..........@" 

### 2.in this code, function names:
#### initBoard() --- generateRandomNum(void);
#### showGameBoard() + updateBoard() --- computeResult();

### 3. An example of passing array to function
```
float average(float age[]);
int main()
{
	float avg, age[] = {23.4, 55, 22.6, 3, 40.5, 18};
	avg = average(age); // Only name of an array is passed as an argument
	printf("Average age = %.2f", avg);
	return 0;
}
float average(float age[])
{
	int i;
	float avg, sum = 0.0;
	for (i = 0; i < 6; ++i) {
		sum += age[i];
	}
	avg = (sum / 6);
	return avg;
}
```
## Part Two
### This part is not realized in the code
'''
For example,inagame with only five maximum guesses,you canâ€™t win if you miss the first two tries and the ship is four spaces long.
